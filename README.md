# SUA Outsmarting Outbreaks Challenge

In Tanzania, climate-sensitive waterborne diseases such as typhoid, amoebiasis, diarrhoea, schistosomiasis, and intestinal worms pose significant health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations like women and children. These diseases are exacerbated by poor water quality, inadequate sanitation, and changing climate patterns, disproportionately affecting communities with limited access to healthcare. With a region in Tanzania as a focus, the lack of predictive tools hinders timely interventions, leaving these populations at greater risk.

The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the outbreaks of climate-sensitive waterborne diseases. Using datasets comprising water sources, toilet quality, waste management, health facility data, and climate information from 2019 to 2023.
